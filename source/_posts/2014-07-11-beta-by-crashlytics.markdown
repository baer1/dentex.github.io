I'm launching a new beta test program based on invitation. It has been developed by Crashlytics; they are the same smart guys that build the library I use in YTD to report errors and force-close events.
It's really well done and functional: I can post directly to the beta testers new builds addressing specific issues; or I can release frequently new beta, because all is integrated into the development environment. And other than that, as all their site and UIs in general, it looks

Basically, this is how it works:

- who's interested can send me a PM on XDA with his/her email address (or a direct mail, if you already know it [hint: PayPal];
- I'll send the invitation to this address (unless the necessary number, type, etc. of testers has been reach);
- you open the email and follow the instructions to install the "Beta" app; it's not a YTD beta, but an app by Crashlytics that works as dashboard to launch all the beta apps you are subscribed to; including YTD.
