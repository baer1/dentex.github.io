Android app to download YouTube video (and extract/convert audio to mp3).

##How to access the app:
- Select the "share" button in the YouTube App while watching a video (or share any YouTube plain text link via any App) and choose "YouTube downloader".
- You'll see all the video codecs and qualities available for the video you're on.
then:
- Press an item to download the video locally (on the device) or to send the download via SSH to a remote PC. Destination machine requirements: Bash and Wget. Other SSH info available;
- Long-press an item and choose between copy to clipboard or share link as text.
Note: such a link (differently from when you send it via SSH) can be only used from the same device where it has been created OR from the same LAN, if you share it to another PC.
From v2.0, extract or convert the audio to mp3 from a downloaded video (dowload FFmpeg and choose extraction).
From v3.0, dashboard to interact with downloaded videos.
