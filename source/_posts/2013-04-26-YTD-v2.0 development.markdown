The development of YTD version 2.0 is slowly coming to the end!

Today I finished the implementation of BugSense to keep track of application's Crashes from the next version's user base, and finally I added a progress bar into the notification for the FFmpeg audio jobs in progress.

Neat.

...from the latest GitHub commits logs:
	
  * implemented BugSense (www.bugsense.com)
  * added progressBar for FFmpeg jobs
  * moved FFmpeg jobs to own thread
  * new screenshots
  * changed README builder
  * improved error handling for FFmpeg process; implemented "remove video" pref
  * tutorials to own menu; audio extraction tutorial entry
  * finished sound/vibration/flash notification option
  * fix FC with no audio extraction enabled (due to NullPointer for the audioConfirm checkbox)
  * starting work for ring/vibration/flash notification setting
  * fixed media scan; reorganized code credits
  * adding confirmation dialog checkbox for audio jobs
