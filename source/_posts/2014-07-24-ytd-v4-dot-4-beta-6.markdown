A new beta for YouTube Downloader is available for download through the app itself, enabling the [proper preference](http://dentex.github.io/blog/2014-07-15/new-beta-program-again/), or downloading directly the apk from [HERE](http://dentex.github.io/files/apk/beta/dentex.youtube.downloader_v4.4-beta-6.apk).

Please share any idea commenting below or join the discussion [over XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2335450).

The changelog is the one from the previous beta:

     v4.4-beta-5 - Jul 22 2014
    -----------------------------------
    [x] configurable downloads queue
    [x] option to invert dashboard's entries click menus
    [x] auto-resume downloads paused due to network failure
    [x] new FFmpeg build targeting non-NEON CPUs (i.e. Tegra devices)
    [x] ability to send logcat to the developer via email
    [x] added Croatian, Indonesian (WIP) and Norwegian (WIP) translations
    [x] fixed dashboard rename with existing filename (thanks m0d)

It just integrates the patch from the stable v4.3.2, addressing another issue with encrypted signature videos.
