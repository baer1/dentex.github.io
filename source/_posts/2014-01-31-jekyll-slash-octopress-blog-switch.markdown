This days I've been setting up this blog using Octopress.

[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is a framework designed by [Brandon Mathis](http://brandonmathis.com/) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the blog aware static site generator powering [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

From their repository descriptions:

{% blockquote https://github.com/imathis/octopress %}
Octopress is an obsessively designed framework for Jekyll blogging. Itâ€™s easy to configure and easy to deploy.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll %}
Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby.
{% endblockquote %}

It's great. It doesn't need all the fluff I've been using with the WordPress blog at SourceForge. Slick and neat: all is managed through the command line, it uses `markdown` sintax and push/pull is done with `git`, directly on your GitHub repo hosting your blog.
