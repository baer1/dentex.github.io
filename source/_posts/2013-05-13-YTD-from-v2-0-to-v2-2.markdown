I finally completed the version 2.0 of YTD, released a few days ago.

Since then, I've been busy trying to fix bugs, thanks to BugSense...

I found that a lot of crashes occurred in "real world scenarios", while all worked perfectly on the "development device" (my personal smartphone - :O - a Samsung Galaxy s2) and the emulators. 

Many of them are now fixed, leading to a more efficient and stable App.
