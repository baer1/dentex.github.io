While I was wandering through the maze of the Internet, again, I discovered another two nice reviews/tutorials about YouTube Downloader and how to use it.

The first one is located on the Blog by Shivkumar Lohar, at [THIS LINK](http://www.stupidtechlife.com/download-format-video-using-youtube-downloader-android-smartphone/).

Other than this, how could we not have an [Instructables entry](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Download-YouTube-videos-on-android/) also?
