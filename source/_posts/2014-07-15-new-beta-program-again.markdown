Seeing the extremely low "XDA acceptance ratio" of the latest beta distribution method, :-) I'm in the process to move from the Crashlytics distribution to an open method where beta versions will be available from the app itself. 

Will be just a matter of switching a setting checkbox:

Please wait for a next update (v4.3.1) to have this feature.
