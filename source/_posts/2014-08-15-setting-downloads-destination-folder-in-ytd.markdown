Now that I implemented the *send log to developer* option (in the beta version only, for now) almost all logs were about one only issue: the notorious KitKat "feature" (...more a bug, actually) thanks to which an app can't be granted with the permission to *write* files on the external (removable) sdcard. 

As of now, for YTD to work properly downloading your preferred videos, you need to choose your device's internal memory storage as downloads destination folder.

Other possibilities are available:

- transfer files between your device's storages with your PC, while it's connected via USB;
- install a custom ROM (i.e. the great [Cyanogenmod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) that has been patched and does not suffer from this issue);
- or if you already have **root** on your device, there are alternative ways as one via the [Xposed framework](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed) and one of its modules.

For your reference, a couple of links on this matter:
