I completed the version 3 for YTD.

The main new feature is a "Dashboard", to interact with downloads.

Are available click and long-click menus for every "state" (in progress, competed, paused, etc) with different actions.

On completed download the single click menu has: Open - Extract audio - Extract and convert to mp3.

Long click to do file management: Copy - Move - Rename and also Re-download video - Remove (from Dashboard only) - Delete (to remove also the file) - Pause/Resume (available when downloads are In-Progress).
